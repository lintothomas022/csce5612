# **Introduction**

On the first day of the course, I was assigned to work with James Cole, a Ph.D. student at the University of North Texas (UNT), for the lab sessions.
The first lab focused on setting up the website, which involved creating the initial structure, adding an image, and embedding a YouTube video as part of the initial configuration.
