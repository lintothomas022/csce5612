Our main project "Advanced Thermal runaway Detection and Delay System forEV Batteries Using Multi-Sensor Integration."  

On the first day of the course, the professor discussed the idea of working on a project. 
I proposed an idea focused on preventing explosions in EV batteries due to thermal runaway. 
I shared the concept with Sai Vijay Sankar Bheemana, and he was excited to collaborate.
We decided to divide the work: he would handle the machine learning aspect, while I would focus on designing the system.

## **Intoduction**
With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), ensuring battery safety has become a critical engineering challenge. One of the most dangerous failure modes in lithium-ion batteries[1] is thermal runaway—a rapid, uncontrollable rise in temperature that can lead to fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. To address this issue, this project proposes a real-time thermal runaway detection[2] and prevention system designed to actively monitor and respond to early warning signs within EV battery packs[3].

The system employs a combination of thermal and gas sensors to detect anomalies. An Adafruit AMG8833 infrared thermal camera continuously monitors the battery’s surface temperature[2], producing a thermal map that reveals localized heating. Simultaneously, an MQ-135 gas sensor[4] detects the presence of hazardous gases that may be released during early-stage battery degradation. These sensor readings are processed by an ESP32 S3 microcontroller, which serves as the system’s central processing unit.

Upon detecting abnormal thermal or gas conditions, the ESP32 S3 initiates two key safety actions. First, it activates a NEMA17 stepper motor, controlled by an Adafruit DRV8833 driver, to push a block of Phase Change Material (PCM)[5] upward toward the battery. This PCM absorbs excess heat and physically separates the battery from potential ignition sources. Second, a warning message is sent to the driver or owner through the device connected to the microcontroller via Bluetooth. Third, the system uses an Adafruit N-channel power MOSFET to immediately break the electrical connection to the battery, halting further energy discharge and reducing the risk of escalation.

The entire setup is enclosed with the battery securely mounted at the edges and the PCM positioned below. The ESP32 S3 and sensors are powered by a 5V battery, while a separate 12V supply drives the motor and driver. This modular and responsive design offers a low-cost yet effective safety mechanism that can be integrated into electric vehicles, enhancing both user safety and system reliability.
