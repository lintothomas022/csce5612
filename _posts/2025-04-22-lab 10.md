The final lab of the Spring 2025 semester introduced us to real-time operating systems (RTOS) and for embedded systems. 
We ran a series of Arduino sketches on the ESP32S3 that demonstrate essential RTOS capabilities, such as task scheduling, memory 
allocation, queuing, and multicore operations. The video below demonstrates the functionality of all 7 exercises, and code screenshots for 
each exercise can be found after the video.
